# Navigating our App: Bottom Navigation View 

If you want to add something you want the school to see, click on the social tab in the navigation bar on the bottom and the same for the notifications or the schoolloop view. If you want to look at schedules, the phone numbers of the school, graduation requirements, clubs, the district calendar, as well as the schedule.

# Features of the App:

Introduced with the splash screen of the app, you are given the choice to access six primary features, which are: 
  Schedule - the schedule button takes you to the EVHS website where the bells schedules are listed
  Classes - the classes button takes you to the evhs website inside the app where you can see the classes evhs has to offer
  Calendar - the calendar project takes you to the district calendar given by the school including the holidays
  Graduation - the graduation button takes you to a WebView of the graduation requirements of EVHS
  Numbers - the numbers button takes you to an image where it shows the crisis numbers on the back of the ID card
  Clubs - the clubs button takes you to the Google sheet where all the clubs are listed
  
# Social
The social tab is a work in progress tab where in the future, there will be social media incorporated into the app and for other EVHub users to connect.

# Schoolloop
The schoolloop tab takes you to a WebView where it shows the mobile WebView for schoolloop and where users can login to view their grades.

# Notifications
The notifications tab will show you the notifications in the app when things change or when social gets implemented.

We hope you enjoy the app cougars!!!
